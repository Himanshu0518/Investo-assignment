Stock Price Forecasting
Objective
The aim of this project is to predict stock prices using historical data. We use ARIMA and XGBoost models to forecast future stock prices based on past trends.

Steps:
Data Collection: The stock price data (closing prices and volume) is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Feature Engineering: Features like lag values, moving averages, percentage change, and volume are added to the dataset.

Modeling:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used for time series forecasting.

XGBoost Regressor is trained using historical features and target price values.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Randomized Search is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Data Source:
Yahoo Finance API (yfinance package)

Results:
The ARIMA and XGBoost models are evaluated and compared based on the above metrics.

Code Structure:
Data Preparation: Fetching the data and feature engineering.

ARIMA Model: Training and forecasting with ARIMA.

XGBoost Model: Training and forecasting with XGBoost.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the XGBoost model using RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluation: Evaluating the models' performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Visualization: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices.

Time Series Analysis of Crop Prices in India
Objective
This project focuses on analyzing crop prices in India over a specific period. The goal is to use time series forecasting to predict future crop prices based on historical data.

Steps:
Data Collection: The crop price data is collected from various agricultural and governmental sources in India.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and formatted for time series analysis, including handling missing values and resampling.

Modeling:

ARIMA model is used to analyze and forecast crop prices.

Seasonal decomposition and trend analysis are performed to understand the patterns.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using statistical metrics like RMSE and MAE.

Data Source:
Government agricultural price data (or a similar dataset, specify the exact source you used).

Results:
The results include predictions for future crop prices, trends, and seasonality.

Code Structure:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the dataset.

Trend Analysis: Identifying trends and seasonality in the data.

ARIMA Model: Applying ARIMA for time series forecasting.

Evaluation: Evaluating the model using RMSE and MAE.

Visualization: Plotting the time series, trend, and predicted values.

Usage:
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels
Run the script to analyze and forecast crop prices:

bash

Edit
python crop_price_analysis.py
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to develop both projects.

yfinance: To fetch stock price data.

XGBoost: For predicting stock prices using a gradient boosting algorithm.

ARIMA: For time series forecasting.

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing results.

scikit-learn: For model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-forecasting-crop-price-analysis.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy

cd stock-price-forecasting-crop-price-analysis
Run the scripts for respective analyses:

Stock Price Forecasting: python stock_price_forecasting.py

Crop Price Analysis: python crop_price_analysis.py

Evaluation Metrics
For both projects, we use the following evaluation metrics to assess model performance:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between prediction and actual values.

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Measures the accuracy as a percentage, useful for comparing model performance across different datasets.

Results

ARIMA Model:

MAE = 16.18

RMSE = 18.685

MAPE = 10.25%

XGBoost Model:

MAE = 3.95

RMSE = 6.74

MAPE = 2.29%

Tuned XGBoost Model:

MAE = 3.54

RMSE = 6.39

MAPE = 1.97%

Crop Price Analysis:
