📊 Stock Price Forecasting
🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the stock prices of companies using historical data. We apply two powerful models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), to forecast the future stock prices.

🔧 Steps
Data Collection: Fetch stock data (Closing prices & Volume) from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Feature Engineering: Create features like lag values, moving averages, and percentage change.

Modeling:

ARIMA: Used for time series forecasting.

XGBoost: A powerful machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices using historical data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the XGBoost model.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using common metrics: MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

🧠 Data Source
Yahoo Finance API using the yfinance package

📊 Results
Model performance comparison using ARIMA and XGBoost.

💻 Code Flow
Data Prep: Download and clean the data.

ARIMA Forecasting: Train and forecast stock prices.

XGBoost Forecasting: Train and tune XGBoost model.

Evaluation: Measure model accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Visualization: Plot actual vs predicted stock prices using matplotlib.

🌾 Time Series Analysis of Crop Prices in India
🎯 Objective
The focus of this project is to forecast crop prices in India, using historical price data. Understanding crop price fluctuations helps farmers and policymakers make informed decisions.

🔧 Steps
Data Collection: Gather data on crop prices from various sources like government agencies.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and format the data, ensuring it’s ready for time series forecasting.

Trend Analysis: Identify seasonality and trend in the crop prices.

ARIMA Forecasting: Apply ARIMA model to predict future prices.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model using MAE and RMSE to assess forecasting accuracy.

🧠 Data Source
Government agricultural datasets (specific source can be mentioned)

📊 Results
Predictions for crop prices in the upcoming months, along with trend analysis.

💻 Code Flow
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset.

Trend & Seasonality: Visualize patterns in the crop prices.

ARIMA Modeling: Apply ARIMA for forecasting future prices.

Evaluation: Measure model accuracy and performance.

Visualization: Plot actual vs predicted crop prices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The main programming language used for building both models.

yfinance: For fetching stock data from Yahoo Finance.

XGBoost: For machine learning-based stock price prediction.

ARIMA: For time series forecasting.

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

matplotlib: For plotting and data visualization.

scikit-learn: For model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

🚀 Getting Started

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Both projects are evaluated using the following metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Provides the error in percentage terms, making it easy to compare across datasets.
